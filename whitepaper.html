    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to StarCycle, where fractional staking meets infinite rewards. In a universe of high-stakes crypto, 7STAR shines bright, with only 752 in existence and a mere ~61 left in the liquidity pool. For many, owning a full 7STAR to stake for RAPR rewards feels light-years away. StarCycle changes that.</p>

    <h2>What is StarCycle?</h2>
    <p>StarCycle is a fractional staking protocol that turns stardust—small pieces of 7STAR—into a spinning engine of RAPR rewards. Here’s how it works:</p>

    <h2>The Pool</h2>
    <p>StarCycle is the ultimate test of conviction—a high-stakes, all-in flywheel for believers in 7STAR’s scarcity. Here’s how it spins:</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Deposit Your Stardust</h2>
    <p>Users contribute stardust in increments of 0.1 (e.g., 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 7STAR) to the StarCycle pool. This stardust is locked—removing it from circulation—shrinking 7STAR’s scarce supply of 752 tokens. Once the pool gathers enough to stake 1 full 7STAR, the flywheel starts.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Full Compounding Commitment</h2>
    <p>All earned RAPR is staked and compounded every Happy Hour, until enough RAPR is earned to buy an additional 7STAR token. No payouts—no exceptions. Compounding continues until the pool accrues 10 7STARs.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: The Faith Vote</h2>
    <p>Once 10 7STARs are accrued, contributors vote:</p>
    <p>- <b>Withdraw:</b> Stop the cycle—send full stars to contributors, proportional to their initial deposit.</p>
    <p>- <b>Keep Spinning:</b> Push to 20 7STARs, cast another vote once achieved.</p>

    <h2>Tokenomics and Ecosystem Impact</h2>
    <p>StarCycle is a gravitational force in the 7STAR and RAPR ecosystem, designed to amplify scarcity, reward holders, and sustain growth. With only 752 7STAR tokens in existence and ~61 left in the liquidity pool, every stardust lock and 7STAR acquisition tightens supply.</p>
    <p>This buy pressure locks 7STARs in “diamond hands”—staked in the pool, untradeable, and held by committed contributors. RAPR remains the ecosystem’s workhorse—its stability ensures StarCycle’s rewards keep flowing while 7STAR soars.</p>
    <p>The impact is seismic: locking 0.1 7STAR kicks off a revenue-generating flywheel, all while shrinking supply and boosting 7STAR’s value. StarCycle doesn’t just reward—it reshapes the galaxy. By locking stardust and cycling 7STARs, it creates a deflationary spiral for 7STAR and a RAPR reward engine that spins indefinitely, aligning incentives for holders, stakers, and the ecosystem at large.</p>

    <h2>Benefits for Participants</h2>
    <p>StarCycle puts cosmic rewards within reach for every staker. Here’s why you’ll want in:</p>
    <p>- <b>Low Entry, High Orbit:</b> Start with just 0.1 7STAR—no need for a full star. Pool your stardust and stake like a whale.</p>
    <p>- <b>Set It and Forget It:</b> Lock once, collect forever. Stake your RAPR earnings weekly for extra thrust.</p>
    <p>- <b>Scarcity Boost:</b> Your locked stardust and pooled 7STARs shrinks the circulation of an already low 752-token supply, driving prices up while you profit. Diamond hands win big.</p>
    <p>- <b>Collective Power:</b> Small contributions fuel a massive flywheel.</p>
    <p>From accessibility to exponential gains, StarCycle rewards the bold—whether you’re dusting off 0.1 7STAR or stacking more, you’re spinning the stars in your favor.</p>

    <h2>Risks & Considerations</h2>
    <p>StarCycle offers stellar rewards, but it’s not without risks. Here’s what to weigh:</p>
    <p>- <b>Price Volatility:</b> 7STAR’s price could soar to $50,000+ as supply shrinks, but RAPR’s $9.50 stability—tied to revenue streams—may lag or dip, slowing 7STAR compounding as the 7STAR/RAPR ratio rises.</p>
    <p>- <b>Liquidity Crunch:</b> With only ~61 7STARs left, liquidity could vanish (i.e., 5 tokens or less), halting new purchases. If this happens, contributors can vote to withdraw full stars or pause the flywheel, enabling all stars to begin full daily payouts.</p>
    <p>- <b>Permanent Burn:</b> Contributing 0.1 7STAR may mean a one-way trip—your stardust is gone forever. High rewards come with high commitment.</p>
    <p>- <b>Market Dependence:</b> RAPR payouts rely on staking yields, and external shifts could impact returns.</p>
    <p>This is a high-risk, high-reward play. Assess your tolerance and consult a financial adviser—StarCycle isn’t financial advice, just a ticket to the stars.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>StarCycle is more than a staking protocol—it’s a cosmic engine. By locking stardust, you power a flywheel that locks 7STARs in diamond hands, shrinks a 752-token supply, and spins out RAPR rewards that scale with scarcity—while driving prices higher. It’s a perpetual cycle of scarcity and profit, built for the bold.</p>
    <p>The galaxy’s shrinking—only ~61 7STARs remain. Join now, turn your stardust into a stake in the stars, and ride the orbit of rising rewards. Lock today, spin forever. Contribute by sending your dust to starstaking.sol in increments of 0.1 (e.g., 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 7STAR) and claim your place in the StarCycle universe—don’t wait for the last star to fade.</p>
